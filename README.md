# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain hight quality software systems. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering involves designing, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products while traditional programming involves coding to solve specific problems
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement-Gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements
Design- Creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functions requirements
Deployment-Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance- Providing outgoing support and updates to the software after deployment
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model is a sequential approach with phases flowing downwards from the begging to the end while agile is an incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements. Helps one to know what they need to come up with the best software
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
It is crucial as it assists developers in maintaining software quality while ensuring that the software is free of defects or bugs.
Unit Testing Definition: Unit testing is a type of software testing in which individual units or components of the software are tested.The main objective of unit testing is to isolate each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every individual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output.
Integration Testing Definition: Integration testing is a type of software testing in which individual software components (modules) are logically integrated (combined) and tested as a group. The main objective of integration testing is to verify whether individual modules, when combined (integrated), work correctly or not as a group.
System Testing Definition: System testing is software testing in which all components are tested together (as a whole) to ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.The main objective of this level of testing is to make sure that the software/product meets specified requirements and runs as smoothly as possible in its operating environment. 
Acceptance Testing Definition: Acceptance testing is a type of software testing that determines whether or not the software should be released to the public.The main objective of acceptance testing is to evaluate whether the software complies with the end-user requirements and whether it is ready for deployment.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
These are software tools that help manage changes to source code over time. E.g Git which offers easy branching and is great for small projects but has file and repo size limits.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Oversees the planning, executiona snd delivery of software projects

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Providing outgoing support and updates to the software after deployment. Types include: Corrective Maintenance: This involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system.
Patching: It is an emergency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management. Patching is done for corrective maintenance but it gives rise to unforeseen future errors due to lack of proper impact analysis.
Adaptive Maintenance: This involves modifying the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware or software, government policies, and business rules.
Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving functionality, performance, and reliability, and restructuring the software system to improve changeability.
Preventive Maintenance: This involves taking measures to prevent future problems, such as optimization, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and implementing preventive measures such as backups.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The software engineering code of ethics is a vital framework for professionals in this field Understanding the importance of ethics, adhering to fundamental principles, and implementing ethical practices are essential for responsible software engineering.By considering ethical implications throughout the development process and staying informed about emerging ethical challenges, professionals can ensure that their products contribute positively to society while upholding ethical standards. They include:Intellectual property rights
When building software, developers must make sure they are not violating anyone's intellectual property rights. Copyright, patents, and trademarks must all be respected.
Security and privacy
The security and privacy of the users' data must be protected by the developers' software. They must take the necessary precautions to protect the data and stop unauthorized access.
Inclusivity and diversity
Software must be inclusive and must not discriminate against any group of users, according to developers.
Social and environmental impact
Developers need to think about how their program might affect people and the environment. They have to avoid producing software that endangers people or the environment.
